# Parking Space Counter

This is a simple computer vision project using OpenCV to count the number of available parking spaces in a car park. The project detects cars parked in spaces from an overhead view and maintains a count of free parking spaces.

- This project was an early OpenCV projects and based on the following YouTube tutorial: [Parking Space Counter using OpenCV Python | Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caKnQlCMIYI&t=4s&ab_channel=Murtaza%27sWorkshop-RoboticsandAI)
- The original author of the tutorial: [Murtaza Hasan](https://github.com/murtazahassan)
- It uses conventional methods to view each car parking space from above and detect whether or not there is a car currently present in the parking space.
- It does this by counting the pixels in a video that has undergone adaptive thresholding.
- It also keeps a current count of how many free parking spaces there are in the car park.
