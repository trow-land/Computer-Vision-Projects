This project as one of my earlier open cv project. It uses conventional methods to view each car parking space 
from above and detect whether or not there is a car currently present int the parking space. It does this by counting
the pixel in a video that has undergone adaptive threshold. It also keeps a current count of how many free 
parking space there are in the car park.
