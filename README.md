# Computer Vision Projects
## The projects contained within this repository are in the process of being split into their own individual repositories whereby this page will be used to signpost you to any relevant projects 

A collection of computer vision projects that I have completed while expanding my knowledge and experience in the field. This repository showcases my ability to work on different computer vision tasks, with a focus on agriculture and recycling/litter detection as they are my main interests. I will be adding more projects to this repository as I complete them alongside my current MSc studies in Robotics and as time permits. For information regarding my MSc dissertation project, ["3D Vision Towards the Robotic Harvest of Shiitake Mushrooms"](https://github.com/trow-land/MSc-Dissertation-Shiitake-Harvest), see that repository.

The majority of my experience has been computer vision related but for more machine learning related projects see [Machine Learning](https://github.com/trow-land/Machine-Learning/tree/main)

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Tom, an aspiring computer vision engineer with a passion for Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Agri-Tech and Environmental Sustainability. While learning I have worked on various computer vision projects that that I think are interesting problems and as a result they are generally focused on agriculture or litter detection. In this repository, you'll find a compilation of those projects, along with their code, descriptions, and results. 

Most of my work is encapsulated within Google Colab-style Jupyter notebooks, which I've found to be an effective learning tool. However, I'm currently in the process of branching some of these projects into their own repositories and preparing to containerise them using Docker.

Below is a brief overview of some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Agri-Tech**
   - Crop Disease Detection: _Using deep learning to identify and classify crop diseases from leaf images._
   - Plant Species Classification: _Leveraging machine learning to distinguish between different plant species._
   - Precision Agriculture: _Applying computer vision techniques to optimise farming practices and resource management._
   - GRowBot: _Crop and Weed Detection, counting and mapping. NPK testing for localised fertiliser recommendations_
   - Apple Counting: _Comparison of conventional and deep learning methods for counting apples in an orchard_

2. **Recycling and Litter Detection**
   - Waste Segregation: _Implementing object detection algorithms to categorise waste materials for efficient recycling._
   - Litter Detection in Public Spaces: _Utilising computer vision models to detectect, classify and segment litter in real-time._
   
3. **Advanced Computer Vision Techniques with TensorFlow**
   - The relevant part of the _TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialisation_ course from Deeplearning.ai
   - Showcased on this repository are the section assessements and the resulting certificate.

## Get in Touch

I am currently seeking opportunities as a Computer Vision Engineer within the UK. I hope the projects shared in this repository clearly demonstrate my dedication and enthusiasm for Computer Vision, particularly in the context of Agri-Tech and environmental sustainability. I am excited to put this enthusiasm to use in a role where I can make a positive impact on agriculture, environment, and beyond.

Apart from professional opportunities, I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or discussions in the field of Computer Vision. If you'd like to connect, offer advice on improving my projects, or discuss potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out.
