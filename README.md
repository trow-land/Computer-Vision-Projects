## Introduction

Hello! I'm Tom, an aspiring computer vision engineer with a passion for Agri-Tech and environmental sustainability. Throughout my journey, I've worked on various computer vision projects that aim to tackle real-world problems in agriculture and waste management. In this repository, you'll find a compilation of those projects, along with their source codes, descriptions, and results.

## Projects Overview

Below is a brief overview of some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Agri-Tech**
   - Crop Disease Detection: _Using deep learning to identify and classify crop diseases from leaf images._
   - Plant Species Classification: _Leveraging machine learning to distinguish between different plant species._
   - Precision Agriculture: _Applying computer vision techniques to optimize farming practices and resource management._

2. **Recycling and Litter Detection**
   - Waste Segregation: _Implementing object detection algorithms to categorize waste materials for efficient recycling._
   - Litter Detection in Public Spaces: _Utilizing computer vision models to identify and track litter in real-time._
