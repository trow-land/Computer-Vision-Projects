# Computer Vision Projects
## The projects contained within this repository are in the process of being split into their own individual repositories whereby this page will be used to signpost you to any relevant projects 

A collection of computer vision projects that I have completed while expanding my knowledge and experience in the field. This repository showcases my ability to work on different computer vision tasks, with a focus on agriculture and recycling/litter detection as they are my main interests. I will be adding more projects to this repository as I complete them alongside my current MSc studies in Robotics and as time permits. For information regarding my MSc dissertation project, ["3D Vision Towards the Robotic Harvest of Shiitake Mushrooms"](https://github.com/trow-land/MSc-Dissertation-Shiitake-Harvest), see that repository.

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Tom, an aspiring computer vision engineer with a passion for Agri-Tech and environmental sustainability. Throughout my journey, I've worked on various computer vision projects that aim to tackle real-world problems in agriculture and waste management. In this repository, you'll find a compilation of those projects, along with their source codes, descriptions, and results.

## Projects Overview

Below is a brief overview of some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Agri-Tech**
   - Crop Disease Detection: _Using deep learning to identify and classify crop diseases from leaf images._
   - Plant Species Classification: _Leveraging machine learning to distinguish between different plant species._
   - Precision Agriculture: _Applying computer vision techniques to optimise farming practices and resource management._

2. **Recycling and Litter Detection**
   - Waste Segregation: _Implementing object detection algorithms to categorise waste materials for efficient recycling._
   - Litter Detection in Public Spaces: _Utilising computer vision models to identify and track litter in real-time._
   
3. **Advanced Computer Vision Techniques with TensorFlow**
   - The relevant part of the _TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialisation_ course from Deeplearning.ai
   - Showcased on this repository are the section assessements and the resulting certificate.
    
_For more detailed information on each project, please navigate to the respective project folder._
