# Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow

This repository contains my assessments for the Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow course. The course covers various aspects of computer vision such as image classification, object localization, object detection, and image segmentation using TensorFlow. Below is a summary of the content and projects in each week of the course.

## Course Structure

### Week 1: Introduction to Computer Vision

In the first week, I learned about image classification, object localization, object detection, and image segmentation. I also gained an understanding of multi-label classification and the differences between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

### Week 2: Object Detection

During the second week, I was introduced to popular object detection models, such as regional-CNN and ResNet-50. I used object detection models from TensorFlow Hub, downloaded and configured them for training, and built my own models for object detection. Using transfer learning, I trained a model to detect and localize rubber duckies with just five training examples. Additionally, I manually labeled my own rubber ducky images.

### Week 3: Image Segmentation

In week three, I focused on image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional neural network. With these networks, I was able to assign class labels to each pixel and perform much more detailed identification of objects compared to bounding boxes. I built the fully convolutional neural network, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN to identify and detect numbers, pets, and even zombies.

### Week 4: Visualization and Interpretability

In the final week, I learned about the importance of model interpretability and understanding how a model arrives at its decisions. I implemented class activation maps, saliency maps, and gradient-weighted class activation maps to identify which parts of an image were being used by the model to make its predictions. I also saw an example of how visualizing a model's intermediate layer activations can help improve the design of a famous network, AlexNet.

## Certificate

Upon completion of the course, I received a certificate as proof of my accomplishment.
